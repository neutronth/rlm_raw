*** This module will not be necessary in version 4. The v4.0.x branch today supports dynamic clients, with all attributes decoded, and available to the unlang policies. ***

# rlm_raw - FreeRADIUS module
The module provides the xlat expansion functionality %{raw: ... } to get the value of attribute from requesting packet.

It's intentionally to be used with the rlm_dynamic_clients that the client's IP address is unknown for pre-configuration. (xDSL, FTTx)

The attribute "NAS-Identifier" or any valid attributes in the requesting packet could be used as information for retrieving settings that required to setup a new client. See EXAMPLE for more details.

It was rewritten for FreeRADIUS 3.0.x and tested with FreeRADIUS 3.0.12

Inspired by the original [rlm_raw_patch](http://sourceforge.net/p/radiusdesk/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/rd_cake/Setup/Radius/rlm_raw_patch?format=raw) by RADIUSDesk.

    &FreeRADIUS-Client-Secret = "%{redis: GET 'rad-secret-%{raw: NAS-Identifier}'}"
  }

```


EXAMPLE
